# Aerogel [WIP] ![CI](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/aerogel/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

[![Thoughts on Solid Developer Experience](docs/img/thoughts-on-solid-developer-experience.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghGmveKKe5Y)

If you want to get into the weeds, you can also read my development journal: [Making a Web Application Framework](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/making-a-web-application-framework).
