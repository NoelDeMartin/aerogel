        learnMore: What is Solid?
        learnMoreMessage: |
            Solid is a decentralized storage protocol built on top of web standards. If you want to use this app across devices,
            you can use Solid to keep changes in sync. Even if you use it in a single device, this will also keep your data secure in case your device is lost.

            In any case, Focus works 100% offline and you can connect your Solid POD later on. If you\'ve never heard of Solid and you\'re just trying things out,
            you can keep using it without an account.
